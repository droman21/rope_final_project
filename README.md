# rope_final_project

R.O.P.E.  =>  Release Operations Process Enforcer.

ROPE was the final project for the WeCan{Code}IT boot camp in the summer of 2020. 
It is a Single Page Web Application that is useful for a team of people responsible for release cycles of software applications. 
The solution is a Web API application written in JavaScript that accesses a C#.NET & SQL backend designed with an MVC pattern. 
Despite the condenced format of the boot camp our team was able to deliver an MVP solution on time. 

This was a group effort with 3 other classmates, therefore the code is currently a bit disorganized.
Currenly I am working to cleanup the code and refactor it for readability and efficiency.
